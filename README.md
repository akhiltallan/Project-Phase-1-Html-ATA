# Project-Phase-1-Html-ATA

I created this portfolio website to present a comprehensive digital profile of myself—Akhil T Allan. The site highlights my educational journey, technical projects, and contact links in a clean, responsive layout. Developed using only HTML and CSS, the portfolio is structured as a multi-page design, each themed with a smooth blue gradient and styled for a modern, immersive experience. From animated transitions to hover effects and well-organized content blocks, every element has been crafted to reflect both professionalism and personality. The goal was to build a visually rich, mobile-friendly platform that showcases who I am, what I’ve done, and how I can be reached—all in one place.
