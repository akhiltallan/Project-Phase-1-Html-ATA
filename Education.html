            I was lucky to have studied in Loyola School till my 10th. These were some of the most memorable days of my life,
            spent with amazing friends, dedicated teachers, and a caring management. A place that shaped my foundation.

          <p>
            For my senior secondary education, I joined Placid Vidya Vihar, Kottayam as part of Brilliant’s Integrated Course. 
            Though academically intense, the experience was truly valuable, laying the groundwork for entrance exams and personal growth.

            Currently, I’m pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita. It's been a great journey so far,
